# SQLite Surf's Up Challenge

## Overview
Purpose:  The client is interested in temperature patterns in Oahu to help inform the success of a proposed new ice cream and surf shop.  Available data from 2010-2017 was analyzed using SQLite and SQLalchemy from 9 weather stations located in Oahu.  The client is specifically interested temperatures during the months of June and December.  A similar past venture in another location was unsuccessful due to unfavorable weather conditions across the winter.   

### Resources
- SQLite: [Hawaii database](https://github.com/lnshewmo/surfs_up/blob/main/hawaii.sqlite)
- SQLalchemy
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

Key differences in weather between June and Dec:
- The average temperature is 3 degrees warmer in June than December
- The median temperature is 4 degrees warmer in June than December
- Half of the time points for June are between 73 and 77 degrees, and half of the time points for December are between 69 and 74 degrees
- These are modest overall temperature differences, with June being slightly warmer than December

### Temperature Statistics
The following tables show the descriptive statistical analysis for 10 years of temperature measurements taken in June vs Dec.

## Summary

Oahu has an established reputation as a surfing destination with year-round conditions to accomodate surfers of all experience levels.  "Big wave" season typically coincides with the winter months (ho'olio) of November to March, and is host to Oahu's most famous surf competitions.  The data analysis for temperatures during this time support the position that temperatures are only slightly lower in the winter (1).
